### Day 1: September 9, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Github guide "Hello World" exercise, creating a repository, a branch, commits, a pull request, and a merge.
**Today's Progress**: I've forked the 100-days-of-code repo and am using this log from it.
