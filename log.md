# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Github guide "Hello World" exercise, creating a repository, a branch, commits, a pull request, and a merge. I've forked the 100-days-of-code repo and am using this log from it.

### Day 2: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I joined freecodecamp.org, signing in with github. I started at the beginning and made it 89% of the way through the first lesson on HTML and HTML5.

**Thoughts**: Almost everything so far is intuitive to me, except that radio button and checkbox inputs are grouped by name rather than simply by being nested in a form.

### Day3: September 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML + HTML 5 section and completed 25% of the CSS section. I feel like the one hint I needed was a cheap shot on FCC's part, because I had used their recommended best practice of f including a generic fallback, which caused the tests to fail.

**Thoughts**: CSS is also mostly intuitive to me so far. Using a period to define a class and the distinct syntax between applying styles within an element vs inside <style> tags will take some remembering.

### Day 4: September 15, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I completed 89% of the Basic CSS section. I skipped yesterday to deal with the leaking washing machine.

**Thoughts** It was nice to have remembered most of what I had learned after three days off. I expect this to help me understand the CSS of SevenFifty pages well enough to solve Appcues problems.

### Day 5: September 16, 2020
**Today's Progeress**: I completed the Basic CSS section and got through ~25% of the Applied Visual Design section. I just learned how to increase line height, which made me wonder whether I can now edit Hubspot email templates to be less ugly.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm getting a good practical understanding of how to use HTML and CSS, but some of the written descriptions are still a little confusing to me. I'm not completely certain, for instance, what a "selector" is. Another term popped up out of the blue that sounded important but that I didn't understand. On the other hand, while I had supposed that CSS "cascades" in the sense that on sheet cascades over the entire site, it sounds like it's the style that cascades from the top of the sheet down, such that the style applied closest to the bottom applies. I should check on that. I'm also excited to be learning (I think) markdown but updating this log!

### Day 6: September 17, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I made it through ~70% of the Applied Visual Design section. Today's exercises were mostly about color theory, which was very interesting. Some exercises were about position, which I can't say I'm completely clear about yet.

**Thoughts**: I was reminded about some things I had learned before, like the specifics of how color hexcodes work. But I also learned a lot about the relationship beteween RGB, CYM, and tertiary colors, about tint, tone, lightness, darkness, and saturation.

### Day 9: September 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I made it over 50% through the Applied Accessibility section. 

**Thoughts**: I tried to work on the couch in the living room today, and it was too distracting.

### Day 10: September 24, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I didn't make it much farther through the Applied Accessibility section today, but I'm back into CSS. I learned how to move elements off the visible page for screen readers to read.

**Thoughts**: I tried to work on the couch in the living room again today, and I was distracted by Simone coming into the kitchen. Finding the right time to do this is going to be tough.
