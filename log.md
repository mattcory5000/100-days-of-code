# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Github guide "Hello World" exercise, creating a repository, a branch, commits, a pull request, and a merge.
**Today's Progress**: I've forked the 100-days-of-code repo and am using this log from it.

## Day2: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress** I joined freecodecamp.org, signing in with github. I started at the beginning and made it 89% of the way through the first lesson on HTML and HTML5.

**Thoughts** Almost everything so far is intuitive to me, except that radio button and checkbox inputs are grouped by name rather than simply by being nested in a form.

## Day3: September 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML + HTML 5 section and completed 25% of the CSS section. I feel like the one hint I needed was a cheap shot on FCC's part, because I had used their recommended best practice of f including a generic fallback, which caused the tests to fail.

**Thoughts** CSS is also mostly intuitive to me so far. Using a period to define a class and the distinct syntax between applying styles within an element vs inside <style> tags will take some remembering.

## Day 4: September 15, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I completed 89% of the Basic CSS section. I skipped yesterday to deal with the leaking washing machine.

**Thoughts** It was nice to have remembered most of what I had learned after three days off. I expect this to help me understand the CSS of SevenFifty pages well enough to solve Appcues problems.
