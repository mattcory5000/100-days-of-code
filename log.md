# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Github guide "Hello World" exercise, creating a repository, a branch, commits, a pull request, and a merge.
**Today's Progress**: I've forked the 100-days-of-code repo and am using this log from it.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
